NFA m10 is as follows:
states = [1, 2]
sigma = ['a', 'b']
start = 1
finals = [2]
delta = {
    (1, 'a') : {1}
    (1, 'b') : {2}
    (2, 'a') : {2}
    (2, 'b') : {1}
}

simplified NFA for m10 is as follows:
states = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sigma = ['a', 'b']
start = 3
finals = [4]
delta = {
    (1, 'a') : {1}
    (1, 'b') : {2}
    (2, '') : {4}
    (2, 'a') : {2}
    (2, 'b') : {1}
    (3, '') : {1}
}

[recursive algo]
regexp is a*b((aUba*b)*)

[iterative algo]
regexp is a*b((aUba*b)*)
